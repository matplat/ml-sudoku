ML - Sudoku
===========

This project is my personal journey through a word of computer vision, machine learning and APIs. I wanted to learn all 
of them to a level when I am able to at least be sure what the code means and does. What is more, that are also my 
almost first steps in the fascinating world of machine learning and neural networks.

## Initial plan

- [ ] base methods for representing Sudoku in Python, using OOP obviously,
- [ ] visualization of sudoku in CLI,
- [ ] simple solver using classic technique,
- [ ] reading sudoku from image,
- [ ] creating NN to solve sudoku (and maybe few other algorithms to test different ML options),
- [ ] generate API using one of the common known frameworks (e.g. FastAPI, Flask, Django),
- [ ] expose the service on GCP or AWS

That is the plan I'd like to stick to in the upcoming days. The summary of what has been done will be visible here.

## Sudoku represenation

TBD

## Solving techniques

### ClassicSolver

TBD

### NNSolver

TBD

### API

TBD

## License

I do not know if any would be needed as this is mostly for my personal use or to serve as a proof of my skills and 
learning abilities, but if it gets required, any information regarding it would be found in this chapter.
